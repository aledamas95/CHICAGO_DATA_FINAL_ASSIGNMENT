# CHICAGO_DATA_FINAL_ASSIGNMENT
This is a project I did on Coursera in the course titled, "Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python."
The data in this project was pulled from three different csv files that I converted into dataframes. I connected each of those dataframes into the "%sql" (Magic SQL) titled "FinalDB.db," and was able to use SQL commands to answer the questions. I also added additional commands to further inspect that the data was accurate.
